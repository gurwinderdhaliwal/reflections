What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
when we commit manually we have more flexibilty and there are less chances of too big commit and there may be scenario where there are too small comit. We have to make decision while making comit
why do you think some versions control systems,like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separetely?
There is repositories in git which contains interrelated file unlike google docs. So change in one commit works on all files.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log is used for all the entries of git commits and git diff is to compare the difference between to comits
